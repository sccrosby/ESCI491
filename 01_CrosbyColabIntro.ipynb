With Google Colabs you don't need to install and compile python on your computer. Google creates a virtual machine on it's servers that runs all the code you write. This means you won't have any issues with special python packages or version.

For example, to view a list of short cuts, use: Ctrl/Cmd M H. Use Ctrl when on a windows computer, and Cmd on a Mac.\n","\n","The most frequently used shortcuts are: <br>\n","Run your cell, **Shift Enter** <br>\n","Insert code cell above, **Ctrl/Cmd M A, A** <br>\n","Insert code cell below, **Ctrl/Cmd M B, B** <br>\n","Delete cell/selection, **Ctrl/Cmd M D, DD** <br>\n","Convert to code cell, Ctrl/Cmd M Y, Y <br>\n","Convert to text cell, Ctrl/Cmd M M, M <br>\n","\n","You should memorize the shortcuts above highlighted in bold.
