    "# Model Skill Metrics\n",
    "Numerical models are ubiquitous in the ocean sciences. A good model, has good skill when compared to observations. But what is good skill? Model skill metrics can be confusing, and what they actaully mean is not always clear. Here we will generate a fake model and some fake data to explore what \"good\" model skill might look like. For this activity we will pretend that we measured water-level and developed a model to predict those water levels. Our units will be in meters (m)"
