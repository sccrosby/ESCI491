# PythonOceanLessons

Here are a compilation of lessons for Oceanography students designed using python notebooks. These were developed with support from a Ocean Observing Institute (OOI) grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) award to Rutgers University. The lessons were implement in the Salish Sea Oceanography course at Western Washington University's Huxely Environmental Sciences Department. They are designed at the upper division undergraduate level but may be revised for students at varying levels. Some lessons have prompts at the end for more complex, less guided analysis for students more comfortable in the python scripting environment.

The lessons are created in Jupyter Notebooks for their simplicity of use and to make transitioning between local python compilations and Google Colabs more seamless. I recommend working locally on your own machine if possible because Google Colabs file navigation is rather cumbersome, and Colabs can be slow when working with size-able datasets. However, when teaching students remotely it can be much easier to use Google Colabs to avoid the inevitable issues installing Python on students personal machines. The most ideal setting for this work is computer lab with Python packages pre-installed.

When working locally I recommend cloning this repository to your personal computer using Git-Hub tools. There are several ways to install Git-Hub and manage repositories, https://github.com/git-guides/install-git, however the easiest use-friendly approach is to use GitHub Desktop, https://desktop.github.com/. Once installed you can use a terminal to navigate to the folder you want the repository cloned in and then use "git clone repo-url" command. You may want to personalize this repo to your own purposes and in that case I recommend that you fork the repository which will make it easier to collaborate in the future.

## What's here

This repo contains several folders with a brief description of each below

1. Lesson_CoastalUpwelling: Student lesson/activity to illustrate the mechanics of upwelling along the U.S. Washington Coastline using observations collected by the Washington OOI endurance array.

2. Lesson_EstuaryCirculation: Student lesson/activity to explore estuary exchange (residual) circulation with model-data from University of Washington's Live Ocean Salish Sea hydrodynamic model

3. Lesson_Waves: Student lesson/activity to investigate the relationship between winds and waves aimed to develop student intuition for local and remote wave generation. These notebooks use observations collected by the National Data Buoy Center

4. Lesson_ErrorMetrics: A brief student lesson/activity to investigate the meaning of error metrics commonly used in scientific literature.

5. Datasets: Archived datasets used in some of the student lessons

6. DataTools_RiverDischarge: A set of python notebooks for students to use to see how to download, post-process, and plot river discharge data from U.S. Geological Survey river gauges.

7. Images: Saved images needed for the python notebooks

8. InDevelopment: Scripts that may be developed into lessons in the future
