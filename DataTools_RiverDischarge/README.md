The USGS maintains gauges at many steams and rivers across the United States. For a map of locations, go to https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html

At each gauge site there is an eight digit site number. You will use this number with the python scripts to select a river gauge dates. For example, the Nooksack river gauged at Ferndale, WA has the number 12213100.

Several scripts are available.

If you are using Jupyter notebooks use this script for quick downloading and plotting
