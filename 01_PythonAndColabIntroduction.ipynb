    "## An Introduction to Python and Google Colabs\n",
    "Here, we will start with the basics of using python jupyter notebooks with some addtional tips for working inside Google Colabs. You can utilize python for data analysis whether you install python locally on your computer or run virtual python environments in Google Colabs. Both approaches have their own advantages, however often it is easiest to get started with Colabs. Goolge Colabs creates a virtual machine on its server that runs all the code you write. This means you won't have any issues with special python packages or version. Scripts run in Google Colabs can be run on any computer with a web browser. While Colabs makes initial setup much simpler, file management and running scripts is much faster and easier on your local machine."

    "The easiest way to use python locally, whether you are running Windows, OSX, or Linux, is to use Anaconda. You can follow the instructions here, https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/. I reccomend performing a complete install with all the reccomended packages. While this will take more space on your computer, it will simplify your experience by not needing to install packages manually. \n",

Colab shortcuts are very similar to jupyter notebook shorcuts, with the addition of a Ctrl/Cmd M key-press in addition to the typical shortcut key (Note, use Ctrl for Windows/Linux and Cmd for OSX). For example, to create a new cell below your current cell on a OSX you press Ctrl-M then A. To view a list of short cuts, use: Ctrl/Cmd M H. \n",

In python, if you start a line with **#** it is designated as a comment. The font color will be gray and the python compiler will ignore all text after the **#**. This allows you to make comments in your code explaning what each part does. It is also very useful in troubleshooting errors to temporarily comment out a section of code that is not working.
